# regionfit
Fit an ellipse to 2D data for a given alpha confidence level.

A standard ellipse with center (0,0) is fitted to transformed data
and an inverse transformation is then performed to get the affine translated ellipse. Assumption of normality is used.

Run example.py for an example of the ellipse fit and data transformer.
